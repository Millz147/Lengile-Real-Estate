 PLANNING AND DESIGN
</u></p>
<p>
The best way to get your dream house is to start from scratch. If you design and build a new property, you will be able to accomplish a result that is closest to your desires. The only problem is that the whole process is quite long and complicated and you will need the help of a professional company that can design and build this home for you.
Designing and building property is a big deal. It requires a lot of work and knowledge. Therefore, many people decide to buy new houses. But the truth is — the real home of your dreams, the one in which every detail meets your expectations, usually is possible only when you design and build it from scratch.
Most people have some vision of their dream house in their minds. Some of them are quite detailed, while others concentrate on a few particulars. Nevertheless, when it comes to designing, an average person doesn't know how to start and what is needed to achieve the desired result. This is the moment in which you need the help of a specialist who can support you in comparing your dreams with reality and finding the best solutions. But what exactly is the best solution?

        The perfect design of a home usually is a compromise between several things, namely: <br>
• dreams and expectations of the client <br>
• practical needs of the person/family <br>
• the amount of money the client wants to spend on building a house  <br>
• real possibilities <br>
• new and better solutions proposed by the contractor <br>
• law regulations <br>
• environmental factors <br>
When an average person tries to design their dream house, they often forget about a lot of the above practical aspects. A highly experienced specialist for whom designing and building houses are daily bread can put all these things together and make from them a real, practical home that will at the same time be the closest to the needs and expectations of the client.

 DESIGNING AND BUILDING

<p>
Although the building may seem to be the major issue, Leng Ile Ltd emphasizes the process of designing, knowing that it is the key to the client’s satisfaction. Thanks to its exceptional customer service, it is one of the best companies that design and build homes in the UK.
The process always starts with a meeting with the client. But this meeting is different from any other you have experienced during your life. The Leng Ile Ltd specialists are ready to listen to all your visions, plans, and dreams and find solutions that will be closest to them. Some construction companies have become rigid over the years, and every time they propose the same, well-known ways to design and construct a new property. That way it doesn’t differ from buying it from a developer. That is not what you will find when talking with Leng Ile Ltd customer service. The biggest joy this company finds in designing and building homes is to conduct unique and exceptional designs according to the dreams of the clients.

They are also ready to advise and propose some innovative methods, thanks to which the best results can be achieved. <br>
After establishing the foundations of the design there must be a confrontation with the place in which the new home is to be built. Sometimes the environmental factors require some minor changes in the plans. When the architectural designs are coming into existence, there is still time for questions and changes. When they are done, Leng Ile Ltd can start building your property, and the only thing you must do is to look at how fast bare ground undergoes a metamorphosis into your dream house. <br>
Our great customer service and desire to build dream houses for our customers is one of the biggest advantages of Leng Ile Ltd but by no means the only one. It is a solid and reliable company that you can trust and with its help building a new house becomes very easy. Moreover, another huge benefit in the short time of executing the project. Of course, preparing the dream house must take some time, but with Leng Ile Ltd it usually lasts shorter than expected, as we are well-known for keeping our deadlines. <br>

        Deciding for a new build means a lot of work, but the results can exceed your expectations. Why it is so good to decide on a new build?
        <br>
• new builds are the most cost-effective — the newest technologies and innovations are used in new builds; therefore, they can save energy in the most efficient way
        <br>
• new builds have the lowest maintenance rate — new builds don’t need any refurbishments and repairs for years, so you don’t have to keep a special budget for it
        <br>
• new builds give you peace of mind — new builds have some years of warranty, which lets you live stressless
        <br>
• new builds are usually focused on safety and security — new builds usually have safety and security alarms, such as smoke alarms and burglar alarms
        <br>
• new builds don’t have to be terraced — terraced buildings have some benefits, but detached houses are much more private and provide much more space around the house; it’s also much easier to sell a house that isn't terraced
        <br>
• in new builds everything is new — all appliances will work perfectly well as they are completely new and there will be no need for renovations anytime soon
        <br>
• new builds have greater value on the market — if you decide to sell your house in a few years, a new build will surely be more valuable than an older one
        <br>
• new builds are adapted to the newest innovations and solutions — new builds cooperate with smart and innovative solutions
        <br>
• new builds always qualify for a mortgage
        <br>
• new builds can be adapted to your expectations
        <br>
When you decide to buy a house, you can always buy an old one or a new build. But choosing a new build gives you a lot of benefits. The only thing you should remember is that not every new build is the same, but if you choose the best new builds contractors, you will not have any regrets.

  LOFT CONVERSIONS
</u></p>
<p>
The biggest advantages of loft conversions and the best way to conduct them.
One of the main problems in private properties is the lack of usable area, but luckily in most cases, there is a simple solution for it. Loft conversions may seem to be a complicated operation but using the services of a professional company will help you obtain additional space at home.
In the 18th and 19th centuries, flats in lofts were usually occupied by the poorest part of society, including bohemians and other artists. Nowadays, converted lofts have become one of the most desirable spaces, ones that create possibilities for unique and exceptional design. Remembering their romantic history, many people want to convert lofts in correspondence to the times when underestimated art grew there in silence. For others, it is just decent, additional space that can be used for a fancy playroom, romantic bedroom, or cozy guest room.

       <p style="font-size: 12px;">
        Besides obtaining an extra room in a property, lofts have several valuable advantages such as:<br>
• A loft conversion can bring order to your house, and it is not only about the extra space. An adapted loft can be used as a big playroom for children and eliminate most of the toys from the rest of the home. It can also be a space for all sorts of activities and stuff that clutters your daily space. At the time of the conversation about the loft, you can also plan a lot of additional storage places <br>
• A loft conversion is a great investment — many people are afraid of investing money in refurbishments, but adjusting a loft can increase the value of property considerably<br>
• Loft conversions often visually balance the house and make it look nicer<br>
• A loft conversion is much cheaper than moving to a home with more bedrooms. Also, you can avoid all the problems connected with moving home<br>
• A loft conversion adds more natural light to your home. A roof window can catch much more sun, which is important for your health<br>
• A loft conversion offers a better view from the windows. People are often surprised by how much they can see from a higher located position<br>
Unfortunately, loft conversions are not as easy as other types of refurbishments, which can often be done on one’s own. First, not every roof space is suitable for adjusting, therefore professional inspection is needed at the start. Then you will need the help of an architect to create plans and set the budget and obtain the required permissions.<br>
Before any work can be started, there is often a need for decent cleaning of the roof space, which sometimes can be very messy and inhabited by small animals. The next step is the rewiring and plumbing, preparing the floor joists and putting floors into it, putting in place walls, windows, and a staircase. And then, at last, comes the right moment to paint the walls, and add all the appliances, furniture, accessories, and decorations.<br>
Putting it all together makes a loft conversion a dreadfully hard and demanding work, which can’t be done by one person, but requires a cooperating team of experienced specialists. If you are looking for someone to carry out loft conversions, you should consider using the services of Leng Ile Ltd.
Leng Ile Ltd provides different kinds of loft extensions such as:<br>
• roof light conversions<br>
• dormer conversions<br>
• mansard conversions<br>
• modular extensions<br>
• hip-to-gable conversions<br>
• gable-to-gable conversions and new box extensions<br>
Our Approach<br>
Research<br>
Thanks to great customer service, and well-experienced, fast, and high-quality commissioning, Leng Ile Ltd is one of the most recommended companies offering loft conversions in the UK.<br>

Planning & Step<br>
One of the biggest advantages of using Leng Ile Ltd services is the fact the clients can trust one company to conduct the whole complicated process of loft conversion. We will take care of everything — from planning and calculating the budget thorough cleaning and preparing the roof space up to all refurbishment works that will be needed. In the end, the client can walk into the room, which is ready to live in and simply enjoy the changes. Hiring more than one company to convert a loft is always risky because it usually increases the cost and the time of the house remodelling.<br>
